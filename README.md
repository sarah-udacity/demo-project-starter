# JavaScript Interactive Website

## Purpose

This project will allow you to apply the skills you have acquired in the introduction to JavaScript course and convert a static website into an interactive web application

## Steps

1. Add a JavaScript file to the project. This file should be in a `js` folder that is in the root of the project
2. Add code to the HTML file to load the JavaScript file. Think about where in the HTML file the JavaScript file should be loaded to ensure that the HTML elements it selects are available
3. Use JavaScript to dynamically add a button to the rendered page after the page has loaded
4. Create a function that updates the text and background image of the page
    * Toggle background image between the two provided images
    * Toggle headline and subhead text between two different messages
    * Toggle button text 
  
5. Add an event listener to the button that runs the function to toggle the page content.
